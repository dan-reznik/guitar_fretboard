title: "Guitar Fretboard"
output: github_document

My attempt at:

* Calculating frequencies of musical scales
* Calculating circle of 5ths' and 4ths' major and minor scales
* Drawing guitar fretboard, show natural notes on it

```{r,echo=F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  cache=T,
  collapse=T,
  comment="#>",
  dpi=300,
  out.width="100%"
)
```

```{r,message=F}
library(tidyverse)
source("scale_util.R")
```

### Creates a "circle of fifths" data frame

```{r}
tones12 <- tibble(degree=1:13,
                  notes=c("C","C#","D","D#","E","F","F#","G","G#","A","A#","B","C2"),
                  notesF=c("C","Db","D","Eb","E","F","Gb","G","Ab","A","Bb","B","C2"),
                  majorIdx=c(T,F,T,F,T,T,F,T,F,T,F,T,T),
                  minorIdx=c(T,F,T,T,F,T,F,T,T,F,T,F,T),
                  freqMult=accumulate(degree[-13],~.x*semitone,.init=1),
                  freq=middleC*freqMult,
                  # 5ths
                  roots5ths=getRoots(12,8), # P5 is 8th note
                  notes5ths=notes[roots5ths],
                  freq5ths=getFreqSeries(12,freqMult[8]),
                  majorScale5ths=map_chr(roots5ths,getScale,notes,majorIdx),
                  majorSharps5ths=map_chr(majorScale5ths,getSharps),
                  minorScale5ths=map_chr(roots5ths,getScale,notes,minorIdx),   
                  minorSharps5ths=map_chr(minorScale5ths,getSharps),
                  # 4ths
                  roots4ths=getRoots(12,6), # P4 is 6th note
                  notes4ths=notesF[roots4ths],
                  freq4ths=getFreqSeries(12,freqMult[6]),
                  majorScale4ths=map_chr(roots4ths,getScale,notesF,majorIdx),
                  majorFlats4ths=map_chr(majorScale4ths,getFlats),
                  minorScale4ths=map_chr(roots4ths,getScale,notesF,minorIdx),
                  minorFlats4ths=map_chr(minorScale4ths,getFlats)
)
```

### Scales w/ the circle of 5ths (signatures have sharps)

```{r,echo=F}
tones12 %>%
  select(degree,
         root=notes5ths,
         major_scale=majorScale5ths,
         major_sharps=majorSharps5ths,
         minor_scale=minorScale5ths,
         minor_sharps=minorSharps5ths) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

### Scales w/ the circle of 4ths (signatures have flats)

```{r,echo=F}
tones12 %>%
  select(degree,
         root=notes4ths,
         major_scale=majorScale4ths,
         major_flats=majorFlats4ths,
         minor_scale=minorScale4ths,
         minor_flats=minorFlats4ths) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

### Draw fretboard w/ naturals

```{r}
draw_naturals(tones12)
```
